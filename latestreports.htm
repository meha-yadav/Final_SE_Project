            <li><a href="https://india.un.org/en/about/about-the-un " class="l1">Indian Government Initiatives (2023-2024)</a> - The Indian Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change continues to release its "State of Environment Reports," which track progress on emission reductions and adaptation strategies. The government also actively collaborates with NITI Aayog, India's policy think tank, on sustainable development strategies.</li><br><br>
            <li><a href="https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/publications/assessing-india-s-ambitious-climate-commitments/ " class="l1">India's Updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) (2022)</a> - In 2022, India revised its NDCs, pledging to reduce the emission intensity of its GDP by 45% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. It also aims to achieve 50% cumulative electric power from non-fossil fuel-based energy sources by 2030 and create a carbon sink of 2.5–3 billion metric tons of CO2 equivalent through forest and tree cover. </li><br><br>
            <li><a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2040031" class="l1">Net-Zero by 2070 (2021)</a> - India announced its commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2070 during COP26 in 2021. To support this, the government launched the Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategies (LT-LEDS) in 2022, focusing on decarbonizing electricity, transport, and industry, while enhancing carbon sequestration through afforestation. </li><br><br>
            <li><a href="https://beeindia.gov.in/en/programmes/carbon-market" class="l1">Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) (2022)</a> - India implemented a robust framework for carbon credit trading in 2022. This scheme incentivizes entities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through market-based mechanisms, complementing its broader climate goals. </li><br><br>
            <li><a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2040031 " class="l1">MISHTI Initiative (2023)</a> - Launched in 2023, this program focuses on conserving mangroves as natural carbon sinks. Restoration efforts under MISHTI target 540 square kilometers of mangroves across coastal states and union territories, enhancing both ecological and community resilience. </li><br><br>
            <li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2/country/india" class="l1">UNEP Emissions Gap Reports (2020-2023)</a> - These annual reports highlight global progress on emissions reductions. The 2023 report stresses that while global emissions must fall by 45% by 2030 for a 1.5°C pathway, current policies, including India's, fall short. India's initiatives, however, are recognized as essential for bridging this gap. </li><br><br>
            <li><a href="https://beeindia.gov.in/en/programmes/carbon-market" class="l1">Bureau of Energy Efficiency Initiatives (2015 onwards)</a> - The Indian government reported saving over 106 million tons of CO2 equivalent since 2015 through energy efficiency measures under the Perform, Achieve, and Trade (PAT) scheme and other programs.</li>
